Function 2: assignWorker()
What it does: Employer assigns a worker to an OPEN gig (if worker wasn't assigned at
creation).
Inputs:
• uint256 _gigId
• address _worker
Logic:
1. Verify gig exists and status is OPEN
2. Verify caller is the employer
3. Verify worker address is not zero
4. Update gig.worker = _worker
5. Update gig.status = ASSIGNED
6. Emit WorkerAssigned(gigId, worker) event
Key checks:• Only employer can call this
• Gig must be in OPEN status
• Worker cannot already be assigned
Why this matters: Allows ﬂexible workﬂow where employers can post ﬁrst, then choose
worker after applications.
